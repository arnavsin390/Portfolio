# **Fight Songs Predictor**
### Libraries: numpy, os, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib
#### Description: 
Created two functions to generate sklearn clusters and a decision tree. The clustering algorithm was evaluated in terms of its ability to predict the year that certain schoolsâ€™ fight songs were written. The decision-tree algorithm was evaluated in terms of its ability to predict that UCLA is a member of the Pac-12 conference. The performance of both were compared against baseline versions of both algorithms to determine effectiveness, where more points were earned the more the learned models outperformed the baselines. Grade: 100%
