# **Breast Cancer SVM**
### Libraries: os, pandas, sklearn, collections, time
#### Description: 
Created SVM models that diagnose breast cancer from images (the data are made up of features already extracted from the original images). Additionally, multiple SVM models were built to satisfy different constraints and maximize different metrics.
1. A linear SVM that achieves at least 97% accuracy
2. Any kernel SVM that achieves 100% precision with acceptable an acceptable recall percentage
3. A non-RBF SVM that achieves 100% recall (i.e., no false negatives).
